Hi there! My name is Aaditya Prasad but I normally go by Aadi. I'm a PhD Student in [the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department](https://bcs.mit.edu/academic-program/brain-and-cognitive-sciences-phd-program) at MIT (since 2024) where I am mentored by [Dr. Steve Flavell](https://flavell.mit.edu). My thesis work revolves around developing connectome-constrained controllers of biomechanically realistic simulations of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* using graph neural networks. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroethology and NeuroAI. In other words, I am interested in developing deep learning-based tools and models to gain understanding of complex animal behaviors with hopes that it inspires better AI algorithms. Before MIT, I completed my masters in data science and undergrad in bioinformatics at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). During my time at UCSD, I was co-mentored by [Talmo Pereira](https://talmolab.org) and [Uri Manor](https://manor.salk.edu) at [the Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://www.salk.edu) and UCSD where I worked on deep learning models for tracking biological agents like animals, cells, and organelles in video timelapses. My current CV can be found in the [CV section](https://aaprasad.github.io/cv/) of this website or [here in pdf format](https://aaprasad.github.io/files/Aaditya_Prasad_cv.pdf). If you want to talk about my research, potential fits in your company/group, collaborations, or just want to chat about anything from video games to philosophy, please don't hesitate to reach out!
